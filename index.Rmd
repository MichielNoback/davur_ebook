# Getting started


## Introduction

Welcome, you have landed at the ebook accompanying my R courses for Life Science students.

Before reading on, you should check whether you are ready to work with R on your own computer.
You should have installed R, RStudio and optionally Tinytech or some other Latex alternative for your OS if you would like to create pdf documents from RMarkdown.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```


## RStudio Shortcuts {#shortcuts}

Here are the best keyboard shortcuts for RStudio:  

- `ctr + 1` go to code editor
- `ctr + 2` go to console
- `ctr + alt + i` insert code chunk (RMarkdown)
- `ctr + enter` run current line
- `ctr + shift + k` knit current document
- `ctr + alt + c` run current code chunk
- `ctr + shift + o` source the current document
